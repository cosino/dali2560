Communication Protocol
======================

The Mega 2560 DALI system acts as a DALI master so it can send/receive
DALI commands to/from its slaves according to an host system's
commands.

Here the communication protocol between the host command and the Mega
2560 DALI system.

The communication port is a standard UART at 115200 8N1.

Each command is syncronous, that is for each command we should get an
answer before the cmd_answer_timeout time expires. If we get no
answers before the cmd_answer_timeout time and after cmd_answer_retries
retries the system must be considered faulty.

By default for all commands the cmd_answer_timeout
is set to 200ms and cmd_answer_retries is set to 5.

All commands/answers are strings written in ASCII terminated by
'\n' (max lenght is 128 bytes).

For telnet compatibility the sequence "\r\n" is accepted as "\n".

All numbers have base 16 (Hex).

All answers are in this form:

	TXXX..XXX\n

where:

 - T: the type of answer, where 'O' is for ok and 'E' is for error

 - X: an optional argument byte 



Remap Commands:
---------------

- remap all: start remapping all slaves on all busses.

        R\n

The remap procedure needs several seconds to accomplish its duty so the host should
check for the end by using the command "Rf" (see below).

- remap unknown: start remapping slaves which haven't short address on all busses.

        Ru\n

The remap procedure needs several seconds to accomplish its duty so the host should
check for the end by using the command "Rf" (see below).

During this stage all other commands will return the error code "BUSY" (see error codes paragraph).

- test for remap finished

        Rf\n

The answer byte is 0x00 for "yes" and a value from 1 to 100 for "no" representing the percentage
of accomplished job.

For this command the answer timeout is 500ms.

- remap all abort

        RA\n

Ask for the remapping procedure abort sequence.

If the master returns an error it means that the abort procedure is failed and it must be issued again.


Single Device Commands:
-----------------------

- device info request on bus 0xb at address 0xXX

        dibXX\n

The answer bytes are the following meaning:

	[0] --> Dev type
	[1] --> Minimum arc value
	[2] --> Maximum arc value
	[3] --> Actual arc value

- device ON on bus 0xb at address 0xXX

        d1bXX\n

Turn on light (or whatever) on the slave device.

- device OFF on bus 0xb at address 0xXX

        d0bXX\n

Turn off light (or whatever) on the slave device.

- device SET ARC at value 0xPP on bus 0xb at address 0xXX

        dabXXPP\n

Set the arc light (or whatever) at specified power on the slave device.

- device CONF in depends of the DevType on bus 0xb at address 0xXX

        dcbXX\n

Execute the correct command sequence for configure the device.


Group Device Commands:
----------------------

- group ON on bus 0xb for group 0xG

        g1bG\n

Turn on light (or whatever) on all slave devices on bus 0xb and in group 0xG.

- group OFF on bus 0xb for group 0xG

        g0bG\n

Turn off light (or whatever) on all slave devices on bus 0xb and in group 0xG.

- group SET ARC at value 0xPP on bus 0xb for group 0xG

        gabGPP\n

Set the arc light (or whatever) at specified power on all slave devices in a group.


Bus Commands:
-------------

- bus detect all slaves

        bdb\n

Detect all sleave devices on bus 0xb.

The answer is a 65 bytes long string where:

* the first element is the return code,

* the i-th element is not 0 if the i-th slave device is present on the bus. 


- bus 0xb set all ON

        b1b\n 

Turn on light (or whatever) on all slaves on specified bus.


- bus 0xb set all OFF

        b0b\n 

Turn off light (or whatever) on all slaves on specified bus.


- bus 0xb set arc at value 0xPP on all slaves on specified bus

        babPP\n

Set the arc light (or whatever) at specified power on all slave devices on speciefied bus.


Error codes
-----------

Here a list of the error codes whose each DALI command can return.

=== Invalid command (0x01)

The submitted command is not valid.

=== Unsupported command (0x02)

The submitted command is not been implemented yet.

=== Bus busy (0x03)

The submitted command cannot be executed because the master is busy.

=== Invalid BUS ID (0x20)

The submitted bus ID is not valid.

=== Invalid DEV address (0x30)

Does not exist any device at this DEV address.

=== Timeout (0x90)

Returned each time a timeout expires.
